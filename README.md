There is a longstanding debate about whether Node.js is a framework. Well more often than not, we do refer to it as one. However, Node.js is actually a JavaScript runtime environment — a platform to execute JavaScript codes on the server-side and make it portable. In layman’s terms, a runtime environment is where developers run a program.

In contrast, frameworks are used to build functions. Many developers have written frameworks for Node.js like Express.js, Meteor.js, and other tools to create unique capabilities for Node.js apps offering convenience to software engineers.
